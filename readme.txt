C64/C128 A/V/S-Video Adapter
============================

This was designed by Sven Petersen. He has separate C64 and C128 adapters
due to the Video and IEC ports being swapped.

I took the C64 design and moved the S-Video connector up beside the RCA
jacks and also moved all top connectors up so that they would not interfere
with the IEC connector. This is tested working on both C64 and C128.

I also added a connector for +5V power, which could be used to power small
devices such as SD2IEC instead of using the cassette port.

For Chroma, Stereo, and Audio in, you can install jumper headers or small switches.
I hope to create a case for it soon.

Note: C64 must have the DIN-8 video port. Also note that some C64's do not have
power on the DIN port but can be modded to add it.
